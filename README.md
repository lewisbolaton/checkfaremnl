## checkFareMNL

Website for centralized access to information about current ticket price for different public transportation options in Metro Manila. Current target for support is all train lines (excluding PNR), and EDSA Carousel.

This is an attempt in developing a **mobile-first web application**. Built with `Nuxt.JS` and is planned to be hosted on a static-site web server.
